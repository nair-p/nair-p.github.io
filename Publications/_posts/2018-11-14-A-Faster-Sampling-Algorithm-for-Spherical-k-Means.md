This work introduces the Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) seeding technique for the Spherical K-means(SPKM) clustering algorithm. SPKM is an unsupervised clustering algorithm similar to *vanilla* K-means algorithm, differing in the metric of distance measurement. In SPKM, the data points are normalised to act as points on a unit hypersphere and the distance between two points is defined using the cosine similarity as opposed to the Euclidean distance used in *vanilla* K-means. In this paper, an MCMC based method is used for choosing the initial k centers.
