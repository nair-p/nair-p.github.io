  When I'm not coding or reading papers, you will find my nose buried in a book that belongs to one of the following categories: novel, adult-fiction, drama, thriller, classic or horror. Sometimes I also like to watch TV shows and movies. 

I occassionally write too. I have two blogs that I try to keep up-to-date -- a [personal](https://96pratheek.wordpress.com/) one and a [technical](https://medium.com/prathena) one. I wouldn't mind considering writing as an alternate career path! 

Sometimes I join the Dance Club members while rehearsing for a performance because I love to dance! 

I also enjoy playing the veena which is an Indian classical music instrument and have received formal training for the same.
