  When I'm not coding or reading papers, you will find my nose buried in a book that belongs to one of the following categories: novel, adult-fiction, drama, thriller, classic or horror. I am a major fan of [Dan Brown](http://danbrown.com/), [Agatha Christie](https://www.agathachristie.com/) and [Khaled Houssini](https://khaledhosseini.com/). Some of the books I've read that have left an impression on me would include

  I occassionally write too. I have two blogs that I try to keep up-to-date --- a personal one called [FreeSpirits](https://96pratheek.wordpress.com/) and a technical one named [Prathena](https://medium.com/prathena). I like to write-up about interesting new technology that I come across or if there is some new philosophy I have discovered of life. If I had to consider an alternate career path - it would be writing! 

  I love engaging in deep, mind-piquing conversations and believe that balance is the key to happiness. I hope to achieve a well-balanced, healthy life-style and strive towards the same. 

  I am also pursuing dance lessons in Kathak, an Indian classical style of dance. I also enjoy others forms of dance styles including fold and Bollywood.

  I play the veena which is an Indian classical music instrument and have received formal training for the same.
