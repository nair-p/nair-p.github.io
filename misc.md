  When I'm not coding or reading papers, you will find my nose buried in a book that belongs to one of the following categories: novel, adult-fiction, drama, thriller, classic or horror. I am a major fan of [Dan Brown](http://danbrown.com/), [Agatha Christie](https://www.agathachristie.com/) and [Khaled Houssini](https://khaledhosseini.com/). Some of the most impressionable books I've read would include

Sometimes I also like to watch TV shows and movies such as [Black Mirror](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/), [The Crown](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4786824/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) and [Predestination](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2397535/?ref_=nv_sr_1).

  I occassionally write too. I have two blogs that I try to keep up-to-date --- a personal one called [FreeSpirits](https://96pratheek.wordpress.com/) and a technical one named [Prathena](https://medium.com/prathena). I like to write-up about interesting new technology that I come across or if there is some new philosophy I have discovered of life. If I had to consider an alternate career path - it would be writing! 

  Sometimes I join the Dance Club members while they rehearse for a performance because I love to dance! I mostly follow the Indian folk and Bollywood styles. 

  I also enjoy playing the veena which is an Indian classical music instrument and have received formal training for the same.
