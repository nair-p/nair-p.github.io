1. **Word Embeddings for the Medical Domain**

     This is an ongoing work on generating word embeddings specifically for medical terms making use of hierarchical ontologies in
medicine. This work is advised by [Prof. G S Raghavan](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=gsrinivasaraghavan). 

2. **Method Summarization from Code**

     This work was carried out while I was an intern at **IBM Research AI Lab, Bangalore** from May'18 to Aug'18. I worked with **Rahul AR** on using sequence-to-sequence models models for solving problems prevalent in Software Engineering -- the automatic generation of method names from method bodies.

3. **Scaling up Simhash**

     This is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that maintains an estimate of the cosine similarity between the original high-dimensional data points. This work was done in collaboration with [Dr. R Pratap](https://sites.google.com/site/prataprameshwaryadav/) and is currently under review at a top tier AI conference.


4. **Detection of star clusters using Pattern Analysis**

     This work was done with [Prof. Sarita Vig](https://www.iist.ac.in/ess/sarita) while I was an intern at the [Indian Institute of Space Sciene and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/) from May'17 to Aug'17. Worked on a direct application of pattern analysis techniques for a highly relevant problem statement in astrophysics.
Used the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm for density estimation and detection of star clusters.
