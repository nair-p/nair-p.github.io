1. **Word Embeddings for the Medical Domain**

     This is an ongoing work for on generating word embeddings specifically for medical terms making use of hierarchical ontologies in
medicine.

2. **Method Summarization from Code**

     This work was carried out while I was an intern at **IBM Research AI Lab, Bangalore** from May'18 to Aug'18. I worked with [Rahul AR]() on using sequence-to-sequence models models for solving problems prevalent in Software Engineering -- the automatic generation of method names from method bodies.

3. **Scaling up Simhash**

     This is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that maintains an estimate of the cosine similarity between the original high-dimensional data points. This work is currently under review at a top tier AI conference. 

4. **A Scalable Clustering Algorithm for Serendipity in Recommender Systems**

     This work addresses the problems of sparsity and overspecialization in Recommender Systems. It proposes SC-CF, a clustering based algorithm that takes diversity, unexpectedness and relevance into consideration while giving recommendations. It affectuates "serendipity" in the recommendations. It makes use of a variant of the Spherical K-Means algorithm to tackle sparsity of data points. This paper is to be presented at ICDM 2018 in Singapore in November, 2018. 

5. **A Faster Sampling Algorithm for Spherical k-means**

     In this work we experimentally validated the SPKM++ algorithm by considering the spherical clustering problem for large sparse document collections. We proved that with our approach, the computational complexity in SPKM++ can be decreased while retaining the clustering results. This paper is to be presented at ACML 2018 in Beijing in November, 2018. 

6. **Detection of star clusters using Pattern Analysis**

     This work was done with [Prof. Sarita Vig](https://www.iist.ac.in/ess/sarita) while I was an intern at the [Indian Institute of Space Sciene and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/) from May'17 to Aug'17. Worked on a direct application of pattern analysis techniques for a highly relevant problem statement in astrophysics.
Used the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm for density estimation and detection of star clusters.
