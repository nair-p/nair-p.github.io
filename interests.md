  **_How can AI be used for social good?_**

Yann LeCun's words -- "*Our intelligence is what makes us human, and AI is an extension of that quality*" -- serve as my motivation to work in this field. 

As a Computer Science major, I am interested in understanding and applying Machine Learning in applications benefitting society. I am especially interested in addressing questions related to the interpretability and explainability of models in socially relevent fields. I give due importance to writing clean, precise code and to presenting visually appealing and reproducible results.

Over the past year I have worked on projects related to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and a significant part of my work has been focused on Data Mining and Topic Modelling algorithms and to a small extent Natural Language Processing and Deep Generative Modelling. I am on the journey of developing AI algorithms that address and solve socially relevant problems.
