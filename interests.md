  **_How well can AI be interlaced with various disciplines like bioinformatics and healthcare to improve living standards?_**

Yann LeCun's words -- "*Our intelligence is what makes us human, and AI is an extension of that quality*" -- serve as my motivation to work in this field. 

As a Computer Science major, I am interested in understanding and applying my technical knowledge in the fields of medicine and healthcare. I believe that the cutting-edge research work in Computer Science is ripe for ardent applicationas in inter-disciplinary areas. My current thesis work is focused on exploiting different Adversarial Generative Models for drug-discovery. I am looking at methods to improve the percentage of valid synthetic drug molecules predicted by generative models. Out of interest and for my better understanding of the area, I am currently reading **Bio-Inspired artificial intelligence** by Dario Floreano.

I am also taking the [Beginner's course on Bioinformatics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioinformatics) by University of California, San Diego in Coursera.
