  **_How well can AI be interlaced with various disciplines like bioinformatics and healthcare to improve living standards?_**

Going by what Yann LeCun said -- "*Our intelligence is what makes us human, and AI is an extension of that quality*" -- it is amazing how much we have already achieved. 

As a Computer Science major, I am interested in understanding and applying my technical knowledge in the fields of medicine and healthcare. Out of my interst and for a better understanding, I am currently reading **Bio-Inspired artificial intelligence** by Dario Floreano.
