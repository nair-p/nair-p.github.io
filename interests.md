  **_How well can AI be interlaced with various disciplines like bioinformatics and healthcare to improve living standards?_**

Yann LeCun's words -- "*Our intelligence is what makes us human, and AI is an extension of that quality*" -- serve as my motivation to work in this field.  

As a Computer Science major, I am interested in understanding and applying my technical knowledge in the fields of medicine and healthcare. My current thesis work is focused on exploiting different Adversarial Generative Models for drug-discovery. Out of interest and for my better understanding of the area, I am currently reading **Bio-Inspired artificial intelligence** by Dario Floreano.
