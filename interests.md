  **_How can AI be used for social good?_**

Yann LeCun's words -- "*Our intelligence is what makes us human, and AI is an extension of that quality*" -- serve as my motivation to work in this field. 

As a Computer Science major, I am interested in understanding and applying Machine Learning in applications benefitting society. I am especially interested in addressing questions related to the interpretability of models in socially relevant fields like social media, healthcare, etc.
