<b><i>How can AI be used for social good?</i></b>

As a Computer Scientist, I am broadly interested in understanding and applying <b>Machine Learning in applications benefitting society</b>. Specifically, I am working on problems in the domain of interconnected data and learning from limited labels (weak supervision, active learning, noisy labels for graphs).

<br><br>

I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://complexdatalabmcgill.github.io/">Complex Data lab</a> at McGill University, School of Computer Science under the supervision of <a href="http://www.reirab.com/">Prof. Reihaneh Rabbany</a>. I work on developing methods to detect organized activity in online escort advertisement spaces. 

<br><br>

I graduated from <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore, India (IIIT-B)</a> and received my M.Tech (Master of Technology) and B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) degrees in IT (Information Technology). 

<br><br>

At IIIT-B, I worked on spherical K-Means clustering algorithms and their application in <b>recommender systems</b>.

<br><br>

I was associated with the Multi-modal Perception Lab at IIIT-B 
<a href="http://mpl.iiitb.ac.in/"> <img border="0" src="/assets/img/mpl.png" width="133" height="100"></a>
and did my M.Tech thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=dineshbabujayagopi">Prof. Dinesh Babu</a>
<br> My thesis work was titled "Deep generative models to generate valid SMILES strings" (sequential representation of molecules). This work focused on improving the percentage of valid SMILES sequences generated using existing deep learning methods by introducing a modified training strategy. 
 
<br><br>

Previously, I was an intern at <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/"><i>IBM Research AI Lab, Bangalore</i></a> where I worked on an application of <b>AI for Software Engineering</b>. I worked on Sequence to Sequence Neural Machine Translation models for method summarization. More details can be found <a href="https://nair-p.github.io/projects/">here</a>.
