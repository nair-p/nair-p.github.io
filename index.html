I am a PhD student in <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~yueli/index.html">Prof. Yue Li's</a> lab at McGill University, School of Computer Science. My work here deals with applications of Machine Learning in healthcare where one aspect is on mining clinical notes like Electronic Health Records.

<br><br>
 
I graduated from <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore, India (IIIT-B)</a> and received my M.Tech (Master of Technology) and B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) degrees in IT (Information Technology). 


<br>

I was associated with the <b><i>Multi-modal Perception Lab</i></b> at IIIT-B 
<a href="http://mpl.iiitb.ac.in/"> <img border="0" src="/assets/img/mpl.png" width="133" height="100"></a>
and did my M.Tech thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=dineshbabujayagopi">Prof. Dinesh Babu</a>
<br> My thesis work was titled <a href= "./assets/Thesis.pdf"><b>Deep generative models to generate valid SMILES strings</b></a>(sequential representation of molecules). This work focused on improving the percentage of valid SMILES sequences generated using existing deep learning methods by introducing a modified training strategy. 

<br> <br>


Previously, I was an intern at <b>IBM Research AI Lab, Bangalore</b> where I worked on an application of <b>AI for Software Engineering</b>. I worked on Sequence to Sequence Neural Machine Translation models for method summarization. More details can be found <a href="https://nair-p.github.io/projects/">here</a>.
