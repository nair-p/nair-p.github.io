I am a final-year student at <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore, India (IIIT-B)</a> where I am pursuing my Master's in Technology (M.Tech) majoring in Computer Science. 

<br> <br>

Over the past year I have worked on projects related to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and a significant part of my work has been focused on Natural Language Processing and to a small extent Computer Vision. I am on the journey of investigating how well-established AI algorithms can be applied to problems in the medical field. 

<br>

I am associated with the <b><i>Multi-modal Perception Lab</i></b> at IIIT-B 
<a href="http://mpl.iiitb.ac.in/"> <img border="0" src="/assets/img/mpl.png" width="133" height="100"></a>
and am doing my thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=dineshbabujayagopi">Prof. Dinesh Babu</a>
<br> My thesis work explores how Deep Learning can work its magic on medical-related problems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery"><b>Drug Discovery</b></a>.

Previously, I was an intern at <b>IBM Research AI Lab, Bangalore</b> for three months where I worked on an application of <b>AI for Software Engineering</b>. I worked on Sequence to Sequence Neural Machine Translation models for this application. More details can be found <a href="https://nair-p.github.io/projects/">here</a>.
