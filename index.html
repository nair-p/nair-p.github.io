I will be joining <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~yueli/index.html">Prof. Yue Li's</a> lab at McGill University, School of Computer Science for a PhD starting Fall 2019 (September). My work here will deal with applications of Machine Learning in healthcare, specifically problems like predicting future states of patient health.

<br><br>
 
I graduated from <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore, India (IIIT-B)</a> with 3.6/4.0 GPA and on the Dean's Merit List and received my M.Tech (Master of Technology) and B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) degrees in IT (Information Technology). 

<br> <br>

Over the past year I have worked on projects related to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and a significant part of my work has been focused on Natural Language Processing and to a small extent Computer Vision. I am on the journey of investigating how well-established AI algorithms can be applied to problems in the medical field.

I was associated with the <b><i>Multi-modal Perception Lab</i></b> at IIIT-B 
<a href="http://mpl.iiitb.ac.in/"> <img border="0" src="/assets/img/mpl.png" width="133" height="100"></a>
and did my M.Tech thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=dineshbabujayagopi">Prof. Dinesh Babu</a>
<br> My thesis work was titled <a href= "./assets/Thesis.pdf"><b>Deep generative models to generate valid SMILES strings</b></a>(sequential representation of molecules). This work focused on improving the percentage of valid SMILES sequences generated using existing deep learning methods by introducing a modified training strategy. 

<br> <br>


Previously, I was an intern at <b>IBM Research AI Lab, Bangalore</b> for three months where I worked on an application of <b>AI for Software Engineering</b>. I worked on Sequence to Sequence Neural Machine Translation models for this application. More details can be found <a href="https://nair-p.github.io/projects/">here</a>.
