<b><i>Can AI understand and solve complex real-world issues?</i></b>

<br><br>

<!-- <i>"Our intelligence is what makes us human, and AI is an extension of that quality"</i> -- Yann LeCun -->

<!-- <br><br> -->

As a Machine Learning Scientist, I am broadly interested in developing data driven approaches to understand and tackle complex real-world problems. My work lies at the intersection of <b> machine learning, natural language processing, and network science</b>, with applications in responsible AI, financial document analysis, and social impact domains.

<br><br>

I earned my PhD from McGill University, School of Computer Science, in 2025, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.reirab.com/">Prof. Reihaneh Rabbany</a> at <a href="https://complexdatalabmcgill.github.io/">Complex Data lab</a>. My doctoral research focused on developing weakly supervised and graph-based methods to detect organized and suspicious activity in online platforms, particularly in online escort advertisement ecosystems. 

<br><br>

I graduated from <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore, India (IIIT-B)</a> and received my M.Tech (Master of Technology) and B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) degrees in IT (Information Technology).

At IIIT-B, I worked on spherical K-Means clustering algorithms and their application in <b>recommender systems</b>.

I did my M.Tech thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=dineshbabujayagopi">Prof. Dinesh Babu</a> and my thesis work focused on improving the validity of AI generated drug discovery (SMILES sequences).

Previously, I was an intern at <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/"><i>IBM Research AI Lab, Bangalore</i></a> where I worked on an application of <b>AI for Software Engineering</b>. I worked on Sequence to Sequence Neural Machine Translation models for method summarization. More details can be found <a href="https://nair-p.github.io/projects/">here</a>. -->
